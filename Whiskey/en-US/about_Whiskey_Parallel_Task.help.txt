SUMMARY
    Runs tasks in parallel.

DESCRIPTION
    The `Parallel` task runs queues of tasks in parallel/asynchronously. The `Parallel` task finishes once all queues finish. Each queue is run in a background PowerShell job (i.e. process). Tasks in each queue are run in the order defined in your whiskey.yml.

    As each queue finishes, its output is received and written to STDOUT. If a task in a queue fails, the other remaining queues are cancelled/aborted/stopped, and the build will fail.

    Define your queues with a "Queues" property, which should be an array of queue objects. Each queue object must have one "Tasks" 

PROPERTIES
    * `Queues`: a list of queues to run. Each queue must have a "Tasks" property, which is a list of tasks to run.

EXAMPLES
    Example 1

        Build:
        - Parallel:
            Queues:
            - Tasks:
                - NUnit2:
                    DisableCodeCoverage: true
                    Path: myassembly.dll
                - NUnit2:
                    DisableCodeCoverage: true
                    Path: myassembly2.dll
            - Tasks:
                - NUnit2:
                    DisableCodeCoverage: true
                    Path: myassembly3.dll

    Demonstrates how to run tasks in parallel. In this example, two task queues will be started. The first queue will run myassembly.dll then myassembly2.dll. The second queue will run myassembly3.dll. The two queues will run at the same time.
