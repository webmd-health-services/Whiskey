DESCRIPTION
    The `PublishBuildStatusToBitbucket` task publishes build status information to Bitbucket for a commit building on a build server. The build information that is published includes the build state, commit hash for the commit being built, name of the build, and the URL to the build.

    Set the `URI` property to the Bitbucket Server URI where you want build statuses reported to. Set the `CredentialID` property to the ID of the credential in the Whiskey credential store to use when connecting to the Bitbucket Server. Use the `Add-WhiskeyCredential` function to add the credential to the build.

    This task only runs when the build is being run by a build server.

PROPERTIES

* `Uri` (***mandatory***): the URI to the Bitbucket Server where you want build statuses reported to.
* `CredentialID` (***mandatory***): the ID of the credential in Whiskey's credential store to use when connecting to the Bitbucket Server. Use the `Add-WhiskeyCredential` function to add the credential to the build.

EXAMPLES
    ## Example 1

    The following example demonstrates publishing the build status to Bitbucket when the build starts and when it completes:

        OnBuildStart:
        - TaskDefaults:
            PublishBuildStatusToBitbucket:
                Uri: https://bitbucket.example.com
                CredentialID: BitbucketCredential
        - PublishBuildStatusToBitbucket

        Build:
        # ...Snip...

        OnBuildEnd:
        - PublishBuildStatusToBitbucket


    ## Example 2

    The following example demonstrates publishing the build status to Bitbucket only when the build ends:

        Build:
        # ...Snip...

        OnBuildEnd:
        - PublishBuildStatusToBitbucket:
            Uri: https://bitbucket.example.com
            CredentialID: BitbucketCredential
